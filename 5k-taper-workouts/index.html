How to Taper for a Big Race · RunAFZ Coaching From runawayfromzombies.com
When a runner says they are going to taper, they are slowly reducing their mileage and the intensity of their training in preparation for a specific event, such as a 5k race. Start the 800s at 10k goal pace and the 300s at 5k goal. For the 5k to 15k, the taper is shorter. Runners training for a specific time goal or pr often spend more time training to incorporate speed and interval workouts.
