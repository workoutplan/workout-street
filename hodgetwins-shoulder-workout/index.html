Chest Shoulders Triceps Workout hodgetwins YouTube From youtube.com
Keith and kevin hodge the “hodgetwins” are famously known for their comedic commentary on the following youtube channels “hodgetwins”, “twin muscle workout” “askhodgetwins”and “fastingtwins” they have earned a respectable 2 million loyal subscribers and grossed over 400 million views over these channels. A common strategy is to divide the program into upper body “push” exercises (i.e., chest, shoulders, triceps), lower body exercises, and upper body “pull” exercises (i.e., upper back, trapezius, and biceps). I also take a day off when i can tell (from experience) that i need one.
