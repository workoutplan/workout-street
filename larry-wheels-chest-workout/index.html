Larry Wheels Bleeds From Chest During 826 x 3 Deadlift! Fitness Volt From fitnessvolt.com
Ive been taking notice to @larry wheels these past few years and truly have to say he is one strong dude!! As you can see, not only does he power 225 pounds off his chest with one arm, he does so without any big struggle—it’s just another part of his workout, seemingly. Attempting to lift 220 kg’s in the incline bench press was the last lift ryan crowley will do for chest in a long time. Morgan is another strong dude, you can find videos of him bench pressing 200kg for 18 reps.
