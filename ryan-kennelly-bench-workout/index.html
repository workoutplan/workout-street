Mens Bench Press Record By Age banqthelove From ban-qthelove.blogspot.com
I have had the chance to meet mendy and he is a great lifter also. This is a workout for late beginners and intermediate lifters designed to help pack on additional chest muscle mass while also bringing up your bench press strength. The question thats usually asked is “how much do you bench”. Right now, kennelly&#39;s best raw gym bench (tap n go) is 675 so he&#39;d have to train specifically for raw benching again if he wants to go after mendelson&#39;s 715.
