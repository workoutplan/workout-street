I just noticed that beachbody posted an entire prenatal/postnatal barre blend program! All my doctors have approved me drinking it in place of my prenatal with the addition of a folic acid and dhea vitamin. Let me start by saying that i have been going to the gym before pregnancy, but i love beachbody workouts bc it’s simple to get them done as a working mother. I&#39;ve been waiting for so long for them to have an actual program rather than those random piecemeal prenatal workouts.
