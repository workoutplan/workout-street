<p>But i think what you're really asking is: For muscular endurance, you should plan to perform one to three sets per bicep for between 12 and 20 repetitions. Generally speaking, working out your arms anywhere from two to six times per week is fine, but it absolutely depends on your fitness level. For example, if you’re 6′ (183cm), you should weigh at least 183lbs (83kg).</p>

Once or maybe twice a week is good but make sure you allow at least 5 or 6 six days in between bicep workouts if youre training them twice a week. Rest periods should be relatively short and last under 30 seconds each to keep your muscles contracting. Pin by Pallu on workout in 2020 Gym workout tips, Gym workout chart.</p>
