<p>If youâre looking to hit the gym when your caffeine boost is at its most powerful, youâre going to want to down a cup of joe roughly 45 minutes before working out.

Contrary to popular belief, working out before bed doesn't necessarily wreak havoc on sleepâas long as you're doing moderate exercise, like a run or bike ride. If you work out in the evening, you will need to recharge your energy for your workout but also avoid getting too revved up so that you can get ready to wind down soon after.</p>
