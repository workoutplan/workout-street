On your days off, take one serving of hemavol™ up to twice daily to aid in recovery. When i take hemavol, i take it 30 minutes pre workout with some faster carbs eaten 30 prior to that. Do you want insane pumps in and out of the gym? Hemavol is so powerful and so precisely dosed that in order to achieve maximum plasma volumization, it should only be taken on training days and no more than 4 times per week.
