<p>When you first hear the word exoskeleton, you might imagine. Designing an exoskeleton arm has long since been thought off even reaching as far back as in 1967 with the hardiman exoskeleton developed by ralph mosher[11]. Its articulations and the shoulder joint allow the shoulder a wide range motions of the arm and are thus quite complex to model. Such apparatus generates shoulder rotation using three orthogonal revolute joints mounted on serial linkages. EksoVest Bionic Exoskeleton HiConsumption.</p>
