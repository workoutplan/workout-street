6 grams of citrulline malate to promote better. Let’s use this pre jym workout review to see how it stacks up in three battles—pre jym vs c4, pre jym vs pre kaged, and pre jym vs 4 gauge. Studies suggest that 1 gram is good for circulatory health, but 6 grams is ideal for the purposes. It’s got a lot of ingredients that not many pre workouts have, so in my opinion, paying $47 for a bottle of this stuff is not a rip off at all.
