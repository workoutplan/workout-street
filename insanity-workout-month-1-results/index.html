Insanity Calendar 60 Day Insanity Workout Schedule From soreyfitness.com
Insanity is 8 weeks long and broken down into 2 phases. This review is a little overdue, but i figured it’s always better to be late than never. Then, around week 6 i lost 6lbs and that has been it. I can’t believe i’m 9 days into the second month of this program.
