Throwing punches side to side will activate your shoulders, abs, and oblique muscles. I think boxers do it because they want to get used to being hit instead of suddenly taking a punch in the stomach for the first time and not being used to that type of pain. Houdini died like that apparently. When using a punching bag, always wear gloves to protect your hands from the impact.
