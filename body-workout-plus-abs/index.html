Raise your shoulders and torso as far as possible from the ground in a curling movement without raising your lower back from the floor. Now speed up the movement, alternating legs quickly as if you were running in place with your hands on the ground. In this class, members can expect a lightweight dumbbell workout moving to the beat of the music. Brace abs and use lower body to start the movement by bending knees, sitting back into hips, and reaching the ball down across the outside of left leg.
